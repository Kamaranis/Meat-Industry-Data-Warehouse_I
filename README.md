# Meat Industry Data Warehouse

## ðŸ“„ Description

This project is a data warehouse solution for a fictional meat distribution company. The main objective is to analyze sales data from an ERP database to gain business intelligence insights. A data cube was developed to explore the information from different perspectives and to facilitate decision-making.
